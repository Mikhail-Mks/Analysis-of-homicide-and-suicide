# Exploratory Data Analysis of Homicide and Suicide Rates

This project explores the relationship between homicide and suicide rates and various socioeconomic factors, including GDP per capita, Gini coefficient, and happiness index. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and loaded into MySQL for cleaning and preprocessing.

In Python, I have analyzed the data and assigned regions based on geographic location using HTML data. I have compared homicide and suicide rates against the aforementioned  factors to uncover any patterns or correlations.

The findings are presented in an interactive Power BI dashboard, allowing users to explore the data visually and gain insights into the factors that contribute to homicide and suicide rates.
